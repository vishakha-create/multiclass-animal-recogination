# multiclass-animal-recogination
Overview
This project implements a multi-class animal recognition model using deep learning techniques. The model is trained to classify images of different animal species using a convolutional neural network (CNN).

Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled images of multiple animal species. The dataset is preprocessed and augmented before being fed into the model.

Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow/Keras
OpenCV
NumPy & Pandas
Matplotlib & Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook
